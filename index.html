        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          With 4+ years in web hosting (LAMP & LEMP stacks) and technical
          support, I've helped businesses manage WordPress, DNS, SSH, and
          server-related challenges. I recently wrapped up my administration and
          payroll support role at Transport for NSW and have transitioned to a
          new position at Housing Australia, where I'm excited to contribute to
          meaningful work in the housing sector. <br />
          <br />Throughout my career, I've developed a strong foundation in
          technical problem-solving while honing my ability to communicate
          complex concepts clearly to diverse audiences. My experience spans
          both technical and administrative domains, giving me a unique
          perspective on how technology can streamline operations and improve
          user experiences. I bring a mix of tech expertise, problem-solving,
          and multitasking abilities to every role. <br />
          <br />Always eager to learn and adapt, I've proactively expanded my
          skill set into React and modern web development, keeping pace with
          industry trends and best practices. Currently, I'm participating in
          the She Codes Australia bootcamp, further deepening my development
          skills and connecting with an inspiring community of women in tech. I
          stay actively engaged with the tech community through continuous
          learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, believing that growth
          comes from both hands-on experience and staying connected with fellow
          professionals in the field.
